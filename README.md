This repository contains the code used for my Master thesis. 

The creation of the custom tokenizer is performed in the 'Tokenizer' notebook.
The way the large language models were trained is displayed in the 'Training' notebook, although they were trained externally on the Snellius computer, so this notebook can be considered as a template.
The evaluation of the models is performed in multiple notebooks. The intrinsic evaluation is performed in the 'Evaluation' notebook, the POS-tagging and Sentiment Analysis is performed in the notebooks with these names.
